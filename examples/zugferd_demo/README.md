# zugferd_demo — Hybrid e-invoice, PDF/A-3U + PDF/UA-1

Demo 7 of the [learning path](../../docs/DEMOS.md#demo-7--zugferd_demo).

**Layer 3.** `uses mormot.ui.report` — nothing else of this project; it
re-exports the PDF/A levels, `afr*` and `PdfMetadataFacturX`.

Reads the invoice data from `factur-x.xml`, draws the invoice with `TGDIPages`
and embeds the same file as an associated file: a hybrid invoice of the
ZUGFeRD 2.x / Factur-X 1.x profile **EN 16931**, as exchanged between
businesses in Germany and France. The file is PDF/A-3U and PDF/UA-1 at once.

**What is special here**

- **The page is read from the file it embeds**, so the two cannot differ.
  `ReadInvoice` fills a record `TInvoice`, the page is drawn from the record —
  that record is where data from your own database or ERP export would go in
- `ReadInvoice` is a demo reader, not an XML parser: fixed element paths, the
  prefixes `rsm:`/`ram:`/`udt:` as in the file, no entities, no validation.
  mORMot2 has no XML reader; a `PosEx` search through the nested tags is
  enough for one known file
- **The source is pure ASCII.** The labels are German without umlauts ("Ihre
  Referenz", "Bankverbindung"); every umlaut and "…" on the page comes from the
  UTF-8 XML as `RawUtf8`. So the same source builds with FPC, Delphi 7 and
  Delphi 2010 without code-point constants. Amounts, dates and the IBAN are
  formatted for a German invoice (`336,90`, `04.04.2016`, groups of four)
- `ExportPdfLevel := pdfa3U` and `ExportPdfTagged := True` before the first
  `NewPage`; `DrawHeading`, `DrawParagraph` and a `TTableLayout` table give
  `H1`, `P` and `Table` with `THead`, `TBody` and a `TFoot` for the three
  totals — no `BeginStructContent` in the demo
- `AddExportPdfAttachment(..., afrAlternative)` embeds the XML;
  `ExportPdfMetadataExtension := PdfMetadataFacturX('EN 16931', ...)` writes
  the `fx:` XMP properties with their PDF/A extension schema. The engine adds
  the `pdfuaid` schema to the same list

**The invoice data is third-party test data**, not written here: test case
`01.01a` of the KoSIT xrechnung-testsuite (Apache-2.0), with its specification
identifier changed from XRechnung to plain EN 16931. The placeholders such as
`[Seller name]` are the original's. Source, change and checksums:
[THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).

**Verified:** the three compilers write the same PDF (dates and `/ID`
masked). The earlier layer-2 version of this demo passed veraPDF `3u` and
`ua1`, Mustang-CLI and PAC 2024 on Windows, Linux and macOS, with one accepted
quality hint — the e-mail addresses are text without a link element (roadmap
W-2); this version is being checked the same way (roadmap R-26).

**Not for invoices to German authorities.** They take pure XML (XRechnung),
not a PDF. The engine only writes the PDF/A-3 container; it neither generates
nor validates invoice XML.

**Switches**, to tell the sources of a checker failure apart:

| Switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--no-attachment` | no `factur-x.xml` in the PDF, no `fx:` metadata; the page is still read from it |
| `--untagged` | no structure tree: PDF/A-3U without PDF/UA |

**Build and run** — `factur-x.xml` is looked up in the current folder, then
two levels above the executable, i.e. in this folder:

```bash
lazbuild zugferd_demo.lpi -B      # Windows: "C:\lazarus\lazbuild.exe" …
bin/<target>/zugferd_demo         # -> zugferd_demo_<os>_<cpu>_<compiler>.pdf, next to the executable
```

Delphi 7 or Delphi 2010 (Win32), with `MORMOT2` set to the mORMot2 checkout:
build from the repository root, run from this folder — the executable lands
one level higher than the FPC one, so the second lookup misses:

```bat
tests\build_delphi7.bat examples\zugferd_demo\zugferd_demo.lpr
cd examples\zugferd_demo
..\..\bin\d7\zugferd_demo\zugferd_demo.exe   &rem -> zugferd_demo_windows_x86_delphi-7.pdf, next to it
```

**Checking the output**

```bash
verapdf -f 3u  zugferd_demo_<os>_<cpu>_<compiler>.pdf     # PDF/A-3U
verapdf -f ua1 zugferd_demo_<os>_<cpu>_<compiler>.pdf     # PDF/UA-1
java -jar Mustang-CLI-<version>.jar --action validate --source zugferd_demo_<os>_<cpu>_<compiler>.pdf
```

**Other files here**

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `factur-x.xml` | the invoice data, read for the page and embedded as it is |
| `THIRD_PARTY.md` | its source, the change made, checksums, validation result |
| `factur-x.LICENSE.txt` | the Apache License 2.0 it comes under |
| `.gitattributes` | keeps the XML's line endings, so the checksum holds |
